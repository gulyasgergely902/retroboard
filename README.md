# Retro Board

### About
Retro Board is an essential tool for teams using Scrum. It makes easier to give feedback on the last sprint without the influence of the other team members.
With retroboard, you can:

  - Create boards for each team or topic,
  - Write sticky notes in three categories (Went well, Needs improvement, Action items),
  - Look back at your last sprint by reviewing the stickies each teammember wrote.

### Features
  - Multiple boards for each team / project / topic
  - 3 categories for adding stickies to: Went well, Needs improvement, Action item
  - Hide / show stickies

### Future plans
  - **Redesign UI**
  - **Export board feature:** export your entire board as a .csv file for later use.
  - **VUE UI:** Rewrite current UI to use VUE for seamless transitions between pages / categories.
  - **Docker image:** you'll only need to install docker and docker-compose to start a local retroboard instance.
