## What is RetroBoard?
You can use RetroBoard with your team and let them share their thoughts on the last sprint or encourage the whole office to form their opinions in form of a global retrospective ceremony! It is an essential tool for teams using Scrum to make easier to give feedback without the influence of the other members.

#### With RetroBoard, you can:

  - Create and manage boards for each team or event,
  - Write green or red notes about the last sprint,
  - Group them to better distinguish between topics,
  - Write action items to make the next one even better.

#### Plans
  - **Redesign UI** :heavy_check_mark:
  - **Export board feature:** export your entire board as a .csv file for later use.
  - **VUE UI:** Rewrite current UI to use VUE for seamless transitions between pages / categories. :heavy_check_mark:
  - **Docker image:** you'll only need to install docker and docker-compose to start a local retroboard instance.
